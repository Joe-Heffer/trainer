# Product design

This AI agent serves as an always-available personal fitness coach that leverages your Strava workout data to provide intelligent, data-driven training guidance. Unlike human trainers limited by scheduling and availability, the agent continuously monitors your performance, analyses patterns across your training history, and adapts your programme in real-time based on how your body is actually responding. It excels at the analytical and consistency aspects of coaching—spotting trends humans might miss, providing unwavering accountability through proactive check-ins, and generating personalised training plans that evolve with your fitness level.

The agent addresses the core challenges most people face with fitness: maintaining motivation, setting realistic goals, avoiding overtraining, and getting expert guidance without the high cost of one-to-one human coaching. For ordinary people, it provides the structure, accountability, and personalised planning needed to achieve fitness goals sustainably. For athletes, it offers sophisticated performance analytics, sport-specific programming, and training load management to optimise performance. Whilst it cannot replace human trainers for form correction or injury rehabilitation, it democratises access to intelligent, responsive coaching that was previously available only to elite athletes or those who could afford regular personal training sessions.

# User roles

Personal trainers offer distinct value across several categories:

## Ordinary People

Trainers help with proper form and technique correction, preventing injuries and ensuring exercises are performed correctly. They provide personalised programmes tailored to individual abilities, limitations, and requirements—such as accommodating old injuries or specific phobias about exercise environments.

A critical function is helping clients set realistic goals and timeframes, preventing discouragement from unrealistic expectations. They also provide accountability—clients are far more likely to show up for scheduled appointments than to self-motivate.

Trainers offer flexibility in scheduling and location, meeting clients at convenient times and places including homes or parks. They integrate nutrition guidance with exercise programming for holistic weight management.

## Athletes

Professional athletes use trainers to understand their physical weaknesses and strengths, setting sport-specific strength and fitness goals that maximise performance. Trainers help athletes develop proper technique and form to maximise natural strength whilst minimising injury risk.

The expertise allows trainers to design training regimes suited to specific sports—what a tennis player needs differs vastly from an American football quarterback. Elite athletes like Tom Brady and LeBron James attribute their longevity to working with personal trainers.
